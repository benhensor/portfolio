# Ben Hensor - Junior Full Stack Developer

Hello and welcome to the repository for my portfolio site. 

I built this page primarily as an opportunity to practice and improve my development abilities in React and JavaScript whilst also having some fun with layouts, CSS and interactivity.

My plan is to continue to build more projects to include here and to continue 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `node server.mjs`

Launches the mail server so that the contact form will function.
